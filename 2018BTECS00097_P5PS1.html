      Due to the increasing demand of graduate engineers specialized in the fields of Electronics and
      Computer Science in mid 80â€™s; the institute established this department in 1986. The department was then named as
      "Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering".The classes for both courses,
      leading to degree in Electronics Engineering and degree in Computer Engineering, were handled by this department
      till 1993,the year in which the department of Computer Science and Engineering was bifurcated.Since then department
      is named as <strong>"Department of Electronics Engineering".</strong>
